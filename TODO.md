# TODO List for Index Page Updates

- [x] Update navbar: Replace "Logo" with "Home" text, add "Account" text next to the user icon, and change bar class from "large" to "small" for smaller text.
- [x] Restructure layout to move footer to bottom: Make the outer div a flex column with min-height 100vh, and wrap the profile sidebar and page container in a flex-grow div to push the footer down.
- [x] Test changes by running `npm run dev` and verifying navbar and footer positioning.
- [x] Move navbar and footer to template.js as reusable components.
- [x] Import and use Navbar and Footer components in index.js.
- [x] Remove duplicate navbar and footer code from index.js and import from template.
